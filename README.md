**`CPU Scheduler Simulation`** is a Java-based project that simulates various CPU scheduling algorithms like `FCFS`, `Round Robin`, and `Priority Scheduling`.
It allows users to test scheduling scenarios by inputting `custom processes` and `analyzing` their execution.

---
## 🚀 Features:

- `Supports Multiple Algorithms`: FCFS, Round Robin, and Priority Scheduling.
- `Custom Process Input`: Add jobs via a text file for testing.
- `Execution Analysis`: Displays Waiting Time and Turnaround Time.
- `User-Friendly CLI`: Simple input and output format for easy understanding.
- `Java-Powered`: Built with Java 17 and runs on IntelliJ IDEA.

---
## 📌 Important Notice:
⚠️ The project will only run if placed in the following directory on your machine:
```bash
E:/Java Language/CPU_Scheduler_Simulation
```
Make sure the project is located in this path to function correctly.

---
## 🛠 Technologies Used:
- `Java 17` – Core language for implementation.
- `IntelliJ IDEA` – Development environment.
- `File Handling` – Reads process details from input files.
